# Workspace Chat Logs

**Did you know?** TeamplGPT allows you to export your chat logs in the correct format to build a fine-tuned model of GPT-3.5 and other available models on OpenAI.

TeamplGPT supports exporting chats as:

- **CSV**
- **JSON**
- **JSON (Alpaca)**
- **JSONL (OpenAI fine-tune)**

Just click export at the top of the screen once at least 10 chat logs are available! Provided you have the correct account permissions, you can view the chat logs per workspace and per user of your TeamplGPT instance.
