# Linux Installation

There are **two** ways to install TeamplGPT on Linux distros

**1. Install using the [installer script](#install-using-the-installer-script)**

**2. Install using [Docker](#install-using-docker)**

## Install using the installer script

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **NOTICE**

➤ TeamplGPT packages as an AppImage but you **will not** be able to boot if you run just the AppImage. Please only use the script below.

➤ Please open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/issues) if you have installation or bootup troubles.

</Callout>

First, open a terminal on your Linux machine and run this command.

```shell copy
curl -fsSL https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/public.useanything.com/latest/installer.sh | sh
```

You can view the raw script contents [here](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/blob/desktop/linux_installer.sh).

This will download the latest version of TeamplGPT's AppImage, unpack it, and then supply a symlink to seamlessly run TeamplGPT.
This script will unpack the app in `$HOME/AnythingLLMDesktop`.

You can start the app at any time by running `./AnythingLLMDesktop/start`. This will boot the app with full logging.

## Install using Docker

Make sure you have installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your machine, if you don't have Docker installed then you can install it by following this [guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

Run this command on your terminal

```shell copy
 docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm
```

It will pull in the latest TeamplGPT image from docker.

Once you have pulled the latest image, run the following commands

```shell copy showLineNumbers
 export STORAGE_LOCATION=$HOME/anythingllm && \
 mkdir -p $STORAGE_LOCATION && \
 touch "$STORAGE_LOCATION/.env" && \
 docker run -d -p 3001:3001 \
 --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
 -v ${STORAGE_LOCATION}:/app/server/storage \
 -v ${STORAGE_LOCATION}/.env:/app/server/.env \
 -e STORAGE_DIR="/app/server/storage" \
 mintplexlabs/anythingllm
```

The above command will mount the storage locally and run TeamplGPT in Docker

Now go to `http://localhost:3001` on your browser and you are now using TeamplGPT!

All your data and progress will persist between container rebuilds or pulls from Docker Hub.
